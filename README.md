Some commands to manage some home devices.

We are managing:

* A Sonoff Smart Remote Control Wi-Fi Switch Smart Home Automation device. You can read [Managing my sonoff device from command-line](https://dev.to/fernand0/managing-my-sonoff-device-from-command-line-1nj6) and [Managing my sonoff from my own program](https://dev.to/fernand0/managing-my-sonoff-from-my-own-program-bhk).
* Our MitraStar GPT-2541GNAC router. You can read some more info in [Please, allow me to control my router from a Python script](https://dev.to/fernand0/please-allow-me-to-control-my-router-from-a-python-script-1ik6). The code I've used here was published in an independent way in [Small script to restart Movistar ES Mitrastar routers](Small script to restart Movistar ES Mitrastar routers).

Maybe I can add more commands in the future.
